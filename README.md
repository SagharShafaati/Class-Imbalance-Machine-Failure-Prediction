# Class-Imbalance-Machine-Failure-Prediction
This repository implements machine learning models for predicting industrial machine failures, addressing class imbalance using SMOTE and employing ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations to improve predictive maintenance.
